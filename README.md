# Laravel Server Requirements Checker
Check if your server satisfies all the requirements to run the specific Laravel version.

## How It Works
Do git clone of this repo inside your server's root directory and then execute it.

For example using Apache server on Ubuntu 16.04, do git clone of this repo inside "var/www/html".
It will create an app folder named "laravel-system-requirements-checker".
Now you can run this using the url "http://localhost/laravel-system-requirements-checker/".
